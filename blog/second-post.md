# Exploring Modern CSS

CSS has evolved so much over the past few years. It's more powerful and expressive than ever before.

## Key Features to Love

Here are a few of the features that have transformed the way I build layouts:

CSS Grid: For complex, two-dimensional layouts, Grid is a game-changer. It provides a level of control that was previously only possible with JavaScript hacks or complex table structures.

Flexbox: Perfect for one-dimensional layouts and component alignment. Aligning items vertically and horizontally has never been easier.

Custom Properties (Variables): CSS variables allow for more maintainable and themeable stylesheets. Defining a color palette or spacing scale at the root level simplifies development immensely.
